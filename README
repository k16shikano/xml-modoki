* Name
xml-modoki.scm
 
* Overview
 A simple parser for xml-like tagged texts to seek a content enclosed with 
 "<tag>" and "</tag>". It provides these functions.
 
   (read-xml)
      returns an xml structuring part from the current input string port.
 
   (xml-maximal-region <tagname> &optional <ignore-tags>)
      returns the first xml element of <tagname> from the current input string port.
      If you want to let the parser ignore some tagged strings, you can specfy the 
      list oof <ignoretags>.

   (for-each-xmlregion <string> <tag> <procedure> &optional <ignore-tags>)
      applys <procedure> for each contents in <string> enclosed with <tag>.

   (attr-list <tag>)
      finds out strings which look like xml attributes from <tag>. 

 You can check xml-modoki-test.scm for more examples.

 It seeks a xml-like coutnet using a recursive descent parsing, and my implementation 
 of that is so naive. It might take a long time to finish your request.
